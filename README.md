# Illenstrator
Illenstrator v1.0 - Wolfgang Enzi 2021

Illenstrator is a python program designed to illustrate some of the
basic concepts of strong gravitational lensing in an interactive manner.

I wrote this program for my supervisor Dr. Simona Vegetti as a thank you
for all her guidance and support during my time at the Max Planck Institute
for Astrophysics and I hope that this small tool will benefit students
both new and old.

Notes on this version:
- The Textbox tool of matplotlib is quite slow, but an improvement may require
restucturing the code significantly. Potentially this can be solved with
Tkinter
- It would be nice to add more precise caustics + critical curves
